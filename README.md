* Notebook 1 (`n1_eda.ipynb`). Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset.
* Notebook 2 (`n2_naive_model.ipynb`). Train-val-test split, decomposition of data into trend and seasonal parts, and forecast with a naive model.
* [WIP] Notebook 3 (`n3_arima_model.ipynb`). Exploration of ARIMA models: AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMAX.
* [WIP] Notebook 4 (`n4_all_models.ipynb`). Comparison of all models.
* Utilities (`utils.py`). Some helper functions, such as `get_data`, or `train_val_test_split`.
* [WIP] Models (`models.py`). Definition of model classes.
